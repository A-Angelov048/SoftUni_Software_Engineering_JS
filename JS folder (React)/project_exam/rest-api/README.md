## Welcome to the RESTful API Application!

The current application is built on Express. It's a server that listens for client requests and returns responses. All CRUD requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are implemented on the server, user authentication is handled via a JWT token, and error handling is in place for invalid data. Client data is stored in MongoDB Atlas or locally, depending on the settings.

## How to run the RESTful API app:
1. `create environment for developer and production` - DATABASE_URL & .etc
2. `npm install` - installing node_modules
3. `npm run start` - starts localhost
4. `configured Firebase settings.` - (it's not required.)
5. `npm run deploy` - firebase functions (it's not required.)
